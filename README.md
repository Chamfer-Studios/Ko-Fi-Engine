# Ko-Fi Engine
Ko-Fi Engine is a software that allows developers to create amazing videogames with a huge toolset that speeds up the development process. Its name comes from 'coffee' which is well known for giving us developers a energy boost when we need it the most. This project is due Q1 2022 and is being developed by Alejandro Ávila Rodríguez and Bosco Barber Esbert for the university subject Engines I at UPC/CITM university.

##Instructions
Ko-Fi features an editor with 4 panels as of today: Hierarchy, Inspector, Console Log and Configurations. Each panel helps you perform a different task.

### Hierarchy
This panel shows all the game objects on your scene in a tree of names. You can select them to see their info on the Inspector or drag and drop them to change their parent-child order.

### Inspector
The Inspector is used to change parameters of the game object and its components. You can use the Transform to change the object position, rotation and scaling. The Material and Mesh check the corresponding info.
